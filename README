FREESP -- Chartreuse 2021

Calculates the free space on a FAT 16 disk very fast. 
On XT Class systems with large FAT 16 hard disks the initial DIR 
command can take upwards of 15-30 seconds to complete, this is due to 
the slow method that DOS uses for calculating free space on the hard
disk.  However once DOS has calculated this value it stores a cache of 
it which it keeps updated unless an application does raw disk accesses
such as CHKDSK.  This means that every subsequent DIR will take no time
to display free space.  This program is designed to quickly calculate 
the free space on the disk by reading through the FAT and counting up
the used clusters then calculating the total number of clusters on the 
disk and subtracting to get the number of free clusters.  Once 
calculated this value is stored into the Disk Parameter Block from DOS
in the field storing the free clusters which DIR uses for calculating 
free space.  With a 2GB FAT 16 partiton on a CF card in an XTIDE 
on my Turbo XT (running at 4.77MHz) this program takes <2s to complete
while the initial DIR call takes 25s. 

This program should run on any PC or compatible with DOS 4.0 or later
it has only been tested on MS-DOS 6.22. This program should be unneeded
on DOS 3.2 and earlier as DIR does not perform a free space calculation,
as well these versions also use FAT12 for disks which DOS keeps more 
metadata in memory and will avoid the slowdown.  It requires 66kB of 
free memory to run, but once complete does not use any, it is not a TSR.

Usage
------------

FREESP <A-Z>

Example:
FREESP C

This will pre-calculate free space on the C partition. I recommend
putting this program into your AUTOEXEC.BAT for each partition on your
system. If you are using 4DOS then you'll want to do this as 4DOS will
perform the free-space calculation before the running of a command
when it has to search the PATH.

Assembling
--------------
This program was created to assemble under Borland Turbo Assembler 2.01
with Borland Turbo Link 2.0

TASM FREESP.ASM
TLINK /T FREESP.OBJ

This will produce FREESP.COM
